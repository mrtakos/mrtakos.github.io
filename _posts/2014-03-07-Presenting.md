## Presenting ##
I recently attended the [DRIVE2014](http://thedriveconference.com/ "DRIVE2014") conference put on by the University of Washington. That same night I missed my local useR Group meeting because I was burnt out on presentations. I have been digging through the slide decks of the stuff I missed and it hit me. These are really well done. What are they using? Thus began my dive into the alternatives to PowerPoint and Google Docs Presentation.

I have been to many conferences and seen many PowerPoint presentations that many people have spent many hours slaving over to make things slide and blink and music play and unfortunately that rarely results in better communication. I think that is why these new technologies appeal to me so much. They are mostly simple and clean.

### Prezi ###
[Prezi](http://prezi.com "Prezi") offers a SAS solution that fundamentally changes the slide show concept. The people at Prezi seem to believe that adhering to the limitations imposed by the old fashioned slide projector is silly. They have built a system that uses a viewport that flys around a very large image map, zooming and panning where needed. 

[Here](http://prezi.com/gx2bm0n9u01f/8-tips-for-an-awesome-prezi/) is an example as my explanation doesnâ€™t do it justice.

I have seen this flying viewport abused for fluff special affects but it has so much potential as well.

### Pandoc ###
If you are already working in plain text of some sort then you should check out [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html). Pandoc converts documents and it has a lot of different document types to choose from. Most interestingly (for this discussion) is outputing in [Slidy]http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/), [Slideous](http://goessner.net/articles/slideous/), [DZSlides](http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/), [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) or [S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/). All of these are HTML + JavaScript based slideshows.

### RStudio ###
Often, I am already in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) making visualizations so this option has great appeal for me.

#### RMarkdown ####
The guys presenting at my local useR Group meetup were using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [ioslides](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/). I really like writing in markdown as it lets me focus on content over technical presentation.

#### RPresentations ####
RStudio has its own built in presentation generator called (surprise!) RPresentations. This is very handy and will render a preview in Rstudio.

## Final Words ##
This was quite a find for me. Please do leave comments below if you have a favorite presentation software you would like to share.
